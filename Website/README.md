TRAC.COM

Website is going to consist of these pages (Tentative):

1. Home:

This will be an overview of the product(s) that we have and scroll controlled animations to help the user better understand the product. It will outline the product and it's capabilities, highlight the ease of use through click commercial video, and the environmental impact it would have.

2. Shop (Dropdown Button)

- Trash Can

This page will be a product page with a rendered/real image. It will have a description of the product and the specs that the product brings. 

- Extras

This page will have most of the extra cost products such as replacement filters, sensors, and possibly a partnered trash bag brand. Each product will have an clickable pop-up that expands to reveal the buy button which will then take them to the buy page. 

3. About Us

This page will be about us... exactly what it says.

4. Support

This page will include a form directing any concerns, complaints, or suggestions towards support specific company email.

5. Login Page

This page will serve as a login page through the Shopify API to reveal customer current/past orders, tracking info. Still need to R&D. Does shopify act as a dynamic JS component within the page itself or does it load you into a new page?

6. Cart Page

This page will feature a nominal cart display without shipping cost included.

7. Purchase Page

This page will serve as a purchase confirmation page, however this is tentative on deletion based on Shopify R&D.
